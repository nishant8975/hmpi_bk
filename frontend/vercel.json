### **Problem 2: Intermittent Data Fetching Failures**

You mentioned that sometimes the dashboard data doesn't load. This is a very common symptom of a **"cold start"** on Render's free tier.

* **What's Happening:** To save resources, Render's free servers "go to sleep" after about 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request comes in (like when you load your dashboard), the server has to wake up. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to a full minute. If the request from your frontend "times out" before the server is fully awake, you will get a connection error, and your data won't load.
* **The Solution:** While the only way to completely eliminate cold starts is to upgrade to a paid plan on Render, we can make your frontend application more resilient to them. We will tell TanStack Query (your data-fetching library) to automatically retry a failed request a few times before showing an error.

**Your Action: Update your Data Fetching Logic**
In your frontend code, wherever you are using `useQuery` to fetch data from the backend, add a `retry` option.

For example, in your **`AdminDashboard.tsx`** file, find your `useQuery` call:

```tsx
// Find this in your dashboard components
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['someData'],
  queryFn: getSomeData,
});
```

**Update it to add the `retry` option:**

```tsx
// Add the retry option
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['someData'],
  queryFn: getSomeData,
  retry: 3, // ✨ This tells it to retry 3 times before failing
});
